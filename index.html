                    <p><b>Baku, Azerbaijan</b></p>
                    <p>It lies on the western shore of the Caspian Sea and the southern side of the Abşeron Peninsula, around the wide curving sweep of the Bay of Baku. The bay, sheltered by the islands of the Baku Archipelago, provides the best harbour of the Caspian, while the Abşeron Peninsula gives protection from violent northerly winds. The name Baku is possibly a contraction of the Persian bad kube (“blown upon by mountain winds”). Baku derives its importance from its oil industry and its administrative functions.</p>

                    <p><b>The City of New York,USA</b></p>
                    <p>New York is the most ethnically diverse, religiously varied, commercially driven, famously congested, and, in the eyes of many, the most attractive urban centre in the country. No other city has contributed more images to the collective consciousness of Americans: Wall Street means finance, Broadway is synonymous with theatre, Fifth Avenue is automatically paired with shopping, Madison Avenue means the advertising industry, Greenwich Village connotes bohemian lifestyles, Seventh Avenue signifies fashion, Tammany Hall defines machine politics, and Harlem evokes images of the Jazz Age, African American aspirations, and slums. The word tenement brings to mind both the miseries of urban life and the upward mobility of striving immigrant masses. New York has more Jews than Tel Aviv, more Irish than Dublin, more Italians than Naples, and more Puerto Ricans than San Juan. </p>

                    <p><b>Special City of Seoul</b></p>
                    <p>The area on the Han River that is now occupied by Seoul has been inhabited by humans for thousands of years, and it acquired strategic importance to the various kingdoms that controlled the Korean peninsula and grew to become a city during the early historic period. Seoul was founded as the capital of a unified nation in 1394 by Gen. Yi Sŏng-gye, the founder of the Chosŏn dynasty. The site was a militarily defensible natural redoubt that was also an especially suitable site for a capital city, lying at the centre of the peninsula and adjoining the navigable Han River, one of the peninsula’s major rivers flowing into the Yellow Sea. The contact afforded by this riverine site with both inland waterways and coastal sea routes was particularly important to Yi because these were the routes by which grain, taxes, and goods were transported.</p>
